Description: virtual private network daemon
 OpenVPN is an application to securely tunnel IP networks over a
 single UDP or TCP port. It can be used to access remote sites, make
 secure point-to-point connections, enhance wireless security, etc.
 .
 OpenVPN uses all of the encryption, authentication, and certification
 features provided by the OpenSSL library (any cipher, key size, or
 HMAC digest).
 .
 OpenVPN may use static, pre-shared keys or TLS-based dynamic key exchange. It
 also supports VPNs with dynamic endpoints (DHCP or dial-up clients), tunnels
 over NAT or connection-oriented stateful firewalls (such as Linux's iptables).
